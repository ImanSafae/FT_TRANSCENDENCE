# FT_TRANSCENDENCE

This project is the **very last of the school 42 common core**, and the **very first web development project**. Its goal is very obviously to be an introduction to web technologies, including:
- frontend with **nest.js** and backend development with a free choice framework - in this case, I chose  **Svelte**
- web sockets with **socket.io**
- database handling with **postgresql** and **Prisma**

The goal is to create a **web single page application**, which features:
- **authorization**, using **OAuth2**, and the 42 intranet API
- a **Pong game**, with a matchmaking system to play against anyone on the network
- a **chat** using websockets, from which you can send people invitations to play, and add them as friends
- a **friend system** that allows you to add people, remove or block them
- a **profile page**, with a history of the games played and the scores, basic information about the person (such as customisable profile picture and username)
- a **2FA (two-factor authentication) system** which can be enabled or disabled and uses the Google Authenticator app.
